:: Lobby
<<set $location = "Infinite Slice Lobby">>\
The lobby of <em>Infinite Slice</em> is an interesting use of space. Its furniture includes only a couple of tables with their respective chairs but also sports a couch and coffee table. When the space isn't being used as the business's dining area, it is repurposed as a living room of sorts for the building's residents.

At one end of the space is the front door, which leads to the alley. It is a rather wide double-sided sliding glass door which leads to the alleyway. On the other end is a cash register and countertop. Next to the register is a small black door.
